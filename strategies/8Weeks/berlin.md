# 18 weeks Corona free - The Trident strategy (Example city : Berlin, Germany)

## The Problem

For the sake of scope, we try to create a model based on the current situation in Berlin and potentially this can be replicated in other cities as well.
The current situation in Berlin is that it has already officially recorded more than 100,000 cases and right now the spread of the virus is in all parts of the city. The current strategy is to impose a strict lockdown and once things improve and we have the vaccine rolled out, to open up the economy again, simillar to what we did in summer. The major flaw in our current strategy is that we have been trying to control the spread of the virus. And we open businesses up when things get slightly better. And this causes the infection to come back as people mingle again. While I understand this is important for the economy, it is not actually helping because we are not able to come back to a normal life and what we need is more certainity in our strategy. 

# The Solution
The key differentiation in my suggestion is to not focus on the spread of the virus but infact try to protect the regions which have become free of infection. I agree this plan will have a large one time cost. But once we go through this, the outcome will hopefully be more permanent. 
So, what is our 8 week plan to control the situation? Needless to say that because we have opened the economy and the situation is worse, we will have to start over with a very strict lockdown. I am really thankful to the government to have already started in this direction. However our current lockdown, while being strict is not enough. And the more important thing is that we will have to open the economy in a more scientific way this time around, resulting in a more long lasting impact. Here are some steps we will have to take. 

## Phase 1: Bring Back Lockdown 1, just like in March: 
The first step is to bring back a very strict lockdown.
The city is completely sealed and only in exceptional circumstances people are able to enter the city. This will ensure no infection is coming from outside the city to Berlin. Only essential goods should be allowed to come into the state. Within the state limits, strict curfew-like conditions should be invoked again. Because of the relaxations and uncertainties, people are now better prepared to handle this situation. This will ensure less opportunities of spread. 

This is absolutely necessary for us to control the situation. We have to make sure that all incoming air, train, road, water travel is completely stopped. In case, this is not possible, we should make a designated area / hotel outside the city, where people are put in a 14 day quarantine. The current home qurantine is unfortunately not enough and we are still bringing in infections from outside the city. 

All public transport within the city should also be stopped immediately. 

## Phase 1-A: Divide state into multiple microeconomic isolated Zones: 

Berlin comprises of 12 districts [https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boroughs_of_Berlin] and the total population of the city is around 3.5 million, so each district has roughly 300,000 residents. We propose to divide each district into four Zones. This division will become the foundation of our recovery later on. Having around 80,000 people in one Zone means enough economic activity can happen in the Zone itself once the lockdown is lifted. These Zones should be designed by taking into account the following:

a. Each Zone is completely sealed from other Zones. So, even when the lockdown is relaxed, people can not travel across the Zones.
b. Each Zone should have enough medical facilities to support their own Zone. Ofcourse for emergencies, we will have to ensure ambulances can take people across zones but primary care should be done within the zone. 
c. The entry and the exit to these Zones is guarded and only in exceptional circumstances people are allowed to cross the Zone boundaries.
d. Restaurants should be closed even for delivery. At this stage when the spread is out of control, we should not risk this. We can allow this in later phases. 
e. Home delivery of groceriers should be the primary mode of getting groceries. We will need to promote this and also subsidise the delivery fees. Deliveries can only happen within the same zone. 
f. All officies, shops - big and small, and kitas should be closed.
g. Wearing a mask is mandatory when people are outside. 

## Phase 2: 21 days to flatten the curve: 

As we know that the virus has a 14 day incubation period, it should take us around 3 weeks to see impact on the numbers. The first two weeks can still see an increase in the number of new cases but from the third week onwards the new cases should start to decline and the curve will begin to flatten. In this time, the government has to create awareness and provide supplies to people so that they don't leave their homes except in emergencies. The lockdown did help us flatten curve  in summer, which means we have evidence that this will work again. In summers in 3–4 weeks after the initial lockdown. Lockdown was announced in early April and curve gets flat in early May.

## Phase 2-A: Measure cases per 100,000 in each Zone and colour code Zones: 

During these first two - three weeks, we should strenghten the color coding system we have developed for marking zones. We are already doing this on a district level but we should now do this at a zone level. The idea is pretty much the same but this is what I would recommend as the classification of zones. It has a couple of additions towards the end. The number we measure is the number of new cases in the last 7 days. Currently most regions in Berlin are having more than 100 cases per 100k in the last 7 days. We have to bring down this number. Each zone should be try to do atleast be doing a 1000 tests every day. We should also consider making testing free. 

1. More than 100 cases / 100k: Maroon Zone
2. Between 25 and 100 : Red Zone
3. Between 10 and 25: Orange Zone
4. Between 5 to 10: Yellow Zone
5. Between 1 to 5: Beige Zone
6. 0: Light Green Zone
7. 0 Cases in last 15 Days and no active cases: Dark Green Zone - Reaching this stage will mean the zone is free from the virus. 
8. Dark green state for 4 weeks: Black Zone

## Phase 3: Go Green to open up: 

This should be our slogan to our people and our local leadership. 'Go Green and open up your zone' 
Measuring this one number will enable us to decide about the next steps for a particular zone. In the beginning most Zones will either be Maroon or Red. By the end of the first 21 days, some Zones will start turning orange and potentially also yellow. So, the rules of opening up will be like this:

1. The state remains sealed. This should stay like this for the foreseeable future.
2. No inter zone travel or activity is allowed even now. This is the last step of our strategy.
3. If a Zone is Maroon or Red even after the initial 21 days, the curfew like lockdown continues in these Zones. More awareness and stricter social distances norms need to be implemented in these areas.
4. If a Zone is Orange: this means the Zone is going in the right direction. The lockdown should still be however maintained strictly. After a Zone stays in this state for a week, only then some relaxation can be thought of. In the beginning relaxation could be to allow online deliveries of food. No entertainment, restaurants, public transport etc should be allowed.
5. Yellow: Getting to the Yellow state should happen in 3–5 weeks, this is when some relaxing can be thought of. At this state the relaxations can be to allow people to order food from outside, opening of smaller shops. No shop or establishment of more than 200 sq meters should be opened. People should enter the shops only maximum of 4 at a time and only if they are wearing masks. They should wait in a queue outside the shop if the shop already has 4 people inside. No offices should still open.
6. Beige: This colour can be achieved by some zones who follow the lockdown strictly in about 4-6 weeks. Once a Zone reaches this state, extreme care has to be taken. In the current situation, no additional relaxations are allowed in this case. This zone is more from a monitoring point of view. 
7. Light Green: This is our first victory and a Zone which follows all the steps, should turn light green in 6 weeks. Other Zones might take 2–3 weeks more to reach here. At this point, some more relaxation should be provided. Masks should still be mandatory indoors in shops however while walking masks may not be required and no entertainment facilities should still open up.
8. Dark Green: This is when we can declare a Zone truly free of the virus. Now at this state, we can safely assume that there is no community based spread within this Zone. Care should be taken however, because some existing active infections could still be there. At this point, more relaxations can be provided within the Zone and businesses who ensure social distancing is taken care of within their establishment, can be opened up. What everyone in the Zone should remember, that by having just one new case, the Zone will lose all its relaxation. If a zone stays dark green for 4 weeks, all restrcitions should be lifted and pre corona life can begin. Ofcourse only within a zone. 

Once a zone stays in the Dark green state for 4 weeks and there are no known active infections, the Zone can be considered completely free of the virus and further economic activities like public transport within the Zone can be started. I can envision that this can already start happening in 12 weeks from the begining of implementing the plan.

If two neighbouring zones are in the dark green state for 4 weeks, the are now the black zone they can be unsealed and people should be allowed to travel inter zones. Again, if at any point even one case is found, the authorities should immediately go back to the individual Zone separation and beige colour for both the zones.

The primary idea of this strategy is to reach the dark green status as soon as possible and protect this status as tightly as possible. We believe that it is better to take the economic hit once for 8–12 weeks rather than reaching a state where the spread is uncontrollable for the government to manage. Once all the zones in the Berlin are in the black color, we can declare Berlin as Corona free. If other neighbouring states also follow the 18 weeks Trident plan and reach 'the black stage' we can also open up the borders with those states when they reach this state. 

## FAQ's: 
1. How long will we keep air traffic and trains closed? 
>> We can open both air and train traffic to states which also follow the 18 week trident plan, once they reach the black zone. Same goes for other countries. Unless they can prove that they are corona free for 4 weeks, we should not allow people to come inside. 
2. This plan will have a huge economic impact, what about that? 
>> I believe it is better to take the economic hit in one go and ensure that once the economy opens up, it can stay open for a longer time. This plan also provides certainity and more confidence and clarity to people as to when things will get back to normal. The current strategy does not allow people to plan anything. 
3. What about vaccination? Wont vaccination already solve the problem?
>> Yes, I hope it does. And this plan will only provide us with the right time and resources to ensure people get vaccinated in a timely fashion. Right now our medical staff is occupied with the rising cases and this will also help reduce the pressure on them. 
4. The plan is not clear to me. Can you provide more details? 
>> Absolutely, there could be points which I have missed and I will be more than happy to discuss and help improve the situation. Email me at: ruknaluak@gmail.com.
